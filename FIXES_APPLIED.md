# Fixes Applied for Coolify Deployment

## Problem Summary
Your application was failing in Coolify with these errors:
- `WARNING: API_KEY is not set`
- `WARNING: ALLOWED_DOMAINS is not set`
- `DATABASE_URL is required`

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Hardcoded Database URL in docker-compose.yml**
The original `docker-compose.yml` had a hardcoded `DATABASE_URL` that ignored environment variables from Coolify.

### 2. **Missing Environment Variables**
The deployment didn't have the required environment variables configured in Coolify's UI.

### 3. **Nginx Conflict**
The original docker-compose included an nginx service that conflicts with Coolify's built-in reverse proxy, causing domain issues.

### 4. **Missing Database Credentials**
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and other database credentials weren't properly configured.

---

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed docker-compose.yml
**Changed:**
- Removed hardcoded `DATABASE_URL` value
- Changed to: `DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}` to properly read from environment
- Added missing environment variables: `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_JOBS_PER_DAY`
- Made `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` use environment variable instead of hardcoded value

### ‚úÖ 2. Created docker-compose.coolify.yml
**What:**
- New Coolify-specific Docker Compose file
- **Removed nginx service** (Coolify provides its own reverse proxy)
- Properly configured to read all environment variables from Coolify
- Uses named volumes instead of bind mounts for better compatibility

**Why:**
This is the file you should use in Coolify (not the regular docker-compose.yml)

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated .env.example
**Added:**
- Your actual API key: `sk_test_4f9b2c8a1e6d3f7a9b2c8e1d6f3a7b9c2e8d1f6a3b7c9e2d8f1a6b3c7e9d2f8a1`
- Your domains: `https://capcut.ogtemplate.com/`, `https://ogtemplate.com/`
- WordPress configuration (URL, username, app password)
- Database credentials with secure password
- All required environment variables

### ‚úÖ 4. Created Deployment Documentation
**Files created:**
- `COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed step-by-step guide
- `COOLIFY_QUICK_SETUP.txt` - Copy-paste ready environment variables
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This file explaining all changes

## What You Need to Do in Coolify

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables
Open `COOLIFY_QUICK_SETUP.txt` and copy ALL the environment variables into Coolify's Environment Variables section.

### Step 2: Configure Docker Compose
In Coolify deployment settings:
- Set "Docker Compose File Path" to: `docker-compose.coolify.yml`

### Step 3: Configure Domain
In Coolify domain settings:
- Add domain: `https://api.trendss.net`
- Set port: `3000`
- Enable SSL (Coolify handles this automatically)

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for deployment to complete.

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ‚úÖ Logs Should Show:
```
Connected to PostgreSQL database
Server starting on port 3000
```

### ‚ùå NO More Error Messages:
- No "WARNING: API_KEY is not set"
- No "WARNING: ALLOWED_DOMAINS is not set"
- No "DATABASE_URL is required"

### ‚úÖ Your API is Available At:
- `https://api.trendss.net/`
- Test health endpoint: `https://api.trendss.net/health`

---

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
1. `docker-compose.yml` - Fixed environment variable handling
2. `.env.example` - Updated with your actual configuration

### Created:
1. `docker-compose.coolify.yml` - Coolify-specific compose file (USE THIS ONE)
2. `COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment guide
3. `COOLIFY_QUICK_SETUP.txt` - Quick copy-paste setup
4. `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This summary document

---

## Why These Fixes Work

1. **Environment Variables Now Work**: The docker-compose files now properly reference `${VARIABLE_NAME}` instead of hardcoding values
2. **Coolify Integration**: Using `docker-compose.coolify.yml` removes nginx conflicts and works with Coolify's proxy
3. **Complete Configuration**: All required variables are documented and provided
4. **Database Connection**: Proper PostgreSQL credentials ensure database connectivity

## Need Help?

If you still see errors after deployment:
1. Check Coolify logs for specific error messages
2. Verify ALL environment variables are added in Coolify UI
3. Make sure you're using `docker-compose.coolify.yml` not `docker-compose.yml`
4. Wait 30-60 seconds after deployment for database initialization

Your application should now deploy successfully without any manual intervention! üöÄ
