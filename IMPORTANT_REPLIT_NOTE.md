# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This Project is Not for Running in Replit

## Project Type: VPS Deployment Only

This is a **production-ready Docker-based microservice** designed for deployment on your own VPS (Virtual Private Server) using Coolify or Docker Compose.

### Why This Won't Run in Replit

1. **Docker is Not Supported** - Replit does not support Docker, Docker Compose, or containerization
2. **Resource Requirements** - Video compression requires significant CPU/memory resources
3. **External Services** - Requires Redis, PostgreSQL, FFmpeg, ImageMagick
4. **Long-Running Jobs** - Video processing can take hours for large files

## What You Have Here

‚úÖ **Complete Go source code** for video/image compression microservice  
‚úÖ **Docker Compose configuration** for easy deployment  
‚úÖ **Nginx reverse proxy** setup with SSL support  
‚úÖ **PostgreSQL database** schema and migrations  
‚úÖ **Redis queue** configuration  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation** for deployment  
‚úÖ **WordPress integration** code
